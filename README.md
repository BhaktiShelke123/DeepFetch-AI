# DeepFetch-AI
Developed a high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ingestion pipeline designed to transform unstructured text data into a searchable, high-dimensional vector database. This project focuses on optimizing document granularity and retrieval accuracy using LangChain and OpenAI’s state-of-the-art embedding models.
